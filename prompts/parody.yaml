clean_article_md: |-
  Your task is to extract the article **title, main body, and author** from a **messy markdown representation of an online article**. The input format varies across sources, and the text may contain extra content before and after the article.  

  ### Extraction Rules:
  - The **title** is typically the first-level heading (`#` in Markdown) or text at the start. If unclear, use your best judgement.
  - The **main body** consists of all readable paragraphs under the title excluding metadata, related stories, footers, and extraneous information. You must copy the main body **VERBATIM**.
  - The **author** is often listed under the title or at the end (e.g., "By John Doe"). Always look for the journalist, not the publishing organization. If not found, return `null`.

  ### JSON Output:
  Return the extracted data in **strict JSON format** as follows:

  ```json
  {
    "title": "Extracted title",
    "body": "Main article text with formatting removed",
    "author": "Extracted journalist or null"
  }
