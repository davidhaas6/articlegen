  # Style Guidelines
  Rat News Network (RNN) distinguishes itself through a striking visual identity that marries simplicity with impact. The network's imagery is characterized by a **flat art style** with a bold, two-color palette of **black and gold**, eschewing gradients and shadows in favor of clean lines and geometric shapes. The designs must ensure clarity and recognizability across various digital platforms while infusing each piece with a modern, slightly playful edge. RNN's visuals consistently incorporate rat-themed elements, cleverly adapting human concepts to rat scale, which reinforces the network's unique perspective and appeals to its rodent audience.
